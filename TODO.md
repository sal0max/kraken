# TODO

## Change name
Google probably thinks *Tuck* is a typo and only suggests apps about T*r*ucks.
Results in basically no downloads up until now.

Possible new names:
- Monk (no need to change icon)
- ?

Questions:
- also change namespace?
- submit as new app to the playstore?

## Group notifications

## Maybe change icon color more Instagram-like
