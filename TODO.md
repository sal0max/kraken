# TODO

## Change name
Google probably thinks *Tuck* is a typo and only suggests apps about T*r*ucks.
Results in basically no downloads up until now.

Possible new names:
- "Monk for Instagram"   (no need to change icon)
- "Kraken for Instagram" (with a nice Instagram-pink)

Questions:
- also change namespace?
- submit as new app to the playstore?

## Group notifications

## Maybe change icon color more Instagram-like

## Support downloading of stories?
